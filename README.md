# MyPortfolio

I built this full-stack web application from scratch to get more familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as providing an online portfolio of my work. 
It is best viewed in full screen format.

## My process

I began this project by exploring different personal websites. Eventually, I stumbled upon a couple of YouTube videos that provided a walk-through of how to begin a personal project. 
I developed in an iterative approach, focusing on just the home page first, then adding pages one by one. Afterward, I used JavaScript to create the reactive menu view and bouncing
icons in the bottom toolbar for a more interactive user experience. Finally, I added the text, images, and information that best represents me!


## Challenges

Like many programming projects, the most challenging part of this project was getting my environment set up. I spent a good deal of time googling errors to resolve these.
My next challenge was dealing with unexpected formatting in CSS. Sometimes the icons I added just disappeared off the page or were stuck behind another component.
After some time fiddling around with the CSS formatting and changing the HTML when necessary, I was able to create a simple front-end UI.

## Highlights

I found it really exciting to build something completely from scratch, beginning with just an empty text editor file. Although this rarely happens in the real world, it helped me to
understand the fundamentals of web development. This bottom-up development approach has come in handy now that I use more frameworks and packages in my programming projects because 
I understand how these tools are helping to "shortcut" the work.
